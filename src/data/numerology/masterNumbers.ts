Keep the peace. Let the day flow and be on time. Do not read. Go within. Don't argue; you won't win. It's not your fault anyway. Be a shining light in the world. You can be greatly inspired today, or you can inspire others.",
    meditation: "I FOLLOW MY INNER STAR! I have a direct pipeline of wisdom and knowledge from the highest source. As I turn within, all the answers I seek are available to me. I inspire others. I am a shining example of love and light. Today I sparkle and shine in a quiet and peaceful way.",

Do more investigating on the spiritual and metaphysical side of life. Universal love is more important than personal love this year. Keep your own inner peace, no matter what. New Thought topics will have more interest for you. This is not a business year, although you will have lots of good ideas for later. Live up to your ideals. Prepare yourself. Fame and honor could come to you this year. Now is a time for inner growth, illumination, and reflection."

If you work only for yourself, you will miss the full advantage of the year. If you work on big plans for the good of many, then your projects will be successful. This is an opportunity for a power year involving big projects. Build something worthwhile. Use all your mental powers. You don't get a year like this often. Prominence and power can be yours."
