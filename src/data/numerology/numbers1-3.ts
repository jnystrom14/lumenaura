      description: "I BREAK NEW GROUND AND BEGIN NEW VENTURES! This is the year for new beginnings, for new starts, for new ideas, for anything new. It is a time to plant, to sow seeds. Seeds planted this year will have an effect on the next eight years. They must first germinate and take root. Only then do they grow. Give your ideas a chance to take root. Develop a plan for what you want in this nine-year cycle, and begin to work on it now. Be yourself, and push forward with determination. Take control. Look to yourself rather than to partnerships or unions. During this time period, independence and self-promotion have a strong influence. Lay your groundwork now. Stay busy and keep things moving. This is your year to pioneer and break new ground."
