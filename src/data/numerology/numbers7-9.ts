    description: "Be alone, at least for part of the day. Be still. Read. Think. Listen to your inner soul. Drop the business world. If you pursue money today, it will run from you. If you keep still and wait, things will come to you. Study something spiritual or scientific. If you read the scriptures, choose Matthew 6 on this day. Work with plants. Take a long walk or a drive in the country. The number 7 always reveals something. Meditate. Be open.",
    meditation: "I LOOK WITHIN AND RECEIVE ANSWERS! I have faith that the Universe is in the process of producing enormous good for me. So silently I take time to go within, to be in touch with my own inner wisdom. I look with love at nature and all her beauty, and I am renewed and refreshed. I trust Life to take care of me. I know that whatever I need will always be there for me. The Power that supplies my breath will supply all else just as easily and freely.",

      description: "I ENJOY THE INNER QUEST AND FIND MANY ANSWERS! This is an inner year. The fruit is just beginning to grow on the vine, and you must have faith that it will ripen. Take time for reflection, study, and self-analysis. Spend lots of time alone, and use it constructively. Analyze your thoughts and actions. What would you like to change about yourself? The number 7 always reveals things that one normally does not see. Look over your life. This year is for inner growth and preparation. Don't reach out or try to force things; let things come to you. Release the business world as much as possible. Meditate; be introspective. Leave your social life for another time. You may travel to learn more about yourself. This is a spiritual year, so flow with it. Allow your soul to grow."

Help someone less fortunate. Success is already yours.",

I have innate good judgment, for I am connected at all times to Universal Intelligence. With the Universe as my partner, I go from success to success.

If you don't use something you own, give it away or sell it. Be an artist. Use your creative talents. It's a great day for a public performance. What you give out will come back to you, so give only the best. Close the chapter; tomorrow you start anew.",
    meditation: "I AM ONE WITH ALL OF LIFE – THE WHOLE WORLD IS MY FAMILY! The work is done, the cycle is complete. Everything is clean. I release and let go; I gladly give away all that I no longer need. I am generous with my fellow travelers on this planet, for they are my brothers and sisters. I forgive and forget. I give feely of my heart and possessions. I have understanding, fulfillment is mine, and I am deeply satisfied. All is well in my world.",

This is the year of spring cleaning. Get into the corners. Review everything and toss out all that is no longer useful in your life—people, places, ideas, and things. If it's finished, let it go. Don't hang on. Many things will pass out of your life this year. Bless them and release them. You are making room for next year. There is much happiness around you. This is a year for endings. Do not begin new things. Don't look for new love affairs now; they won't last. Enjoy the artistic part of life. Take a long trip and learn about, and give to, others. Be tolerant, compassionate, and forgiving. Love must be shared with all. Really understand the kinship of everyone on this planet. The old cycle closes. Make ready for the new one next year."
